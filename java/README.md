# Assignment 0 - Java Setup

Welcome to Assignment 0! In this assignment, you will be setting up Java in your machine for future projects, and getting used to writing tests for your code. 

## Installation

To get started, you will need to have Java and Gradle installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can download them from the official website: [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
## Assignment

Currently, this is just starter code with a basic test case. 
Your task is to create a `Roster` class in the `Roster.java` file. Your `Roster` class should  maintain a roster of the `andrewIDs` for students in a given course. You should be able to add an `andrewIDs`, check if a given `andrewIDs` exists, and remove an `andrewIDs`.


Once you have created your `Roster` class, you should write tests for it in a `RosterTest.java` file. Your tests should cover all the methods in your `Roster` class and should ensure that they are working correctly. Remeber, a 100% branch and line coverage is required for full marks.

To test - 
```
gradle test
```

## Submission

To submit your assignment, you should take a (FULL) screenshot of all your tests passing and your code passing linting. Will look something like this -

You should then upload your screenshot to the assignment submission page on Gradescope.

Good luck and have fun!
