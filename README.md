## Assignment 0 - Hello World
Welcome to Assignment 0! In this assignment, you will be setting up your development environment for future projects, and getting used to writing tests for your code.

## Choose your destiny
You can choose to do this assignment in either Java, Typescript or Python. All three languages might come into play later in the course, so we recommend you try and set all three up. However, if you are already familiar with one of the languages, you can choose to do the assignment in that language.

There will however, be **+10 bonus marks** for completing the assignment in all three languages.

For more information on how to set up your development environment for each language, please refer to the **README.md** files in the respective directories.

## Submission

1. Edit languages.txt and add the language you completed the assignment in. 
`(python/ts/java/all)`
Make sure to have no trailing spaces or newlines.

2. After completing the assignment by following the instructions in the README.md files, take a (FULL) screenshot of all your tests passing.

3. You should then upload a document with your chosen language, a link to your repository, and your screenshot; to the assignment submission page on Gradescope.

4. Pushing your code to github would automatically trigger the autograder for your test cases. You can check the status of your submission on the Github actions tab.
